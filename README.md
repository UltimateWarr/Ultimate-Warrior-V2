A completely custom & original zero ping/skill-emulation module designed for competitive assault-stance & defense-stance warriors.

## Features:
* Highly aggressive & polished skill-emulation engine offering unparalleled smoothness and the lowest skill delays attainable: far surpassing NGSP, PR, free SP and Bern script in speed, responsiveness and fluidity.
* Client-side edge counter with server synchronization and three distinct, configurable modes. UW V2 introduces a superior, truly client-side edge counter mode.
* Instant cooldown system with full support for reset skills. Gameplay is substantially more responsive and intuitive at all ping types, even at low ping. Skills “queue” up better internally, leading to higher HPMs and smoother gameplay than ever before. Reaping Slash and Charging Slash resets are now actually demarcated. <sub>UW V2</sub>
* Faster skill chaining due to UW-exclusive optimizations.
* Blade Draw & Rain of Blows Early Cancel Prevention allowing pressed skills to *automatically* initiate at the earliest time as to not lose Rain of Blows or Blade Draw edge.
* Client-side abnormality system (instant Traverse Cut icon, Deadly Gamble icon and other internal benefits). <sub>UW V2</sub>
* Fully client-side Backstab & Charging Slash.
* Anti-bodyblock alternative that works universally. <sub>UW V2</sub>
* Accurate skill hit registration - no skill desync, missed skills or boss collision issues.
* Substantial improvements to backstab location. <sub>UW V2</sub>
* Solution for the game design flaw causing consumables to yield a slow, unchained Blade Draw, Rain of Blows or Traverse Cut. <sub>UW V2</sub>
* Integrated fps tax & client latency skill speed compensation. <sub>UW V2</sub>
* In-built custom boss ping remover. <sub>UW V2</sub>
* Instant stamina system. <sub>UW V2</sub>
* dynamicStabilityMode gives complete control over the stability of the module. The aim with this mode is to allow the option of a stabilized experience for high spread or high ping users. <sub>UW V2</sub>
* External ping method for more accurate ping values. <sub>UW V2</sub>
* Blade Waltz no longer has any animation restarts. <sub>UW V2</sub>
* Defense-stance automatic block cancel feature.
* Prevention of accidental, unchained Blade Draw, Traverse Cut, and Blade Frenzy casts.
* Defense-stance Rising Fury block skip - with option to only function when movement keys aren’t pressed. <sub>UW V2</sub>
* Prevention of desync between boss model and boss’s position. <sub>UW V2</sub>
* Ability to prohibit early cancels of the Deadly Gamble skill. DG skill is also ended upon a confirmed start of DG mode. <sub>UW V2</sub>
* Backstab no-boss target prevention.
* Countless unmentioned improvements versus older versions.
