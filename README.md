# Ultimate Warrior - custom skill-emulation module
Written from the ground-up: a completely custom & original zero ping/skill-emulation module designed for competitive assault-stance & defense-stance warriors (level 65+).

Ethical and retains the essence of warrior whilst offering advantages (but no blatant cheats or exploits which defeat the point in playing). 
Intended for competitive players who take pride in playing the class properly with their own two hands, whilst desiring to dominate in HPM. 
Over a year in the culmination, developed and continually refined by a top-level warrior.

Rediscover the joy of playing with the fastest, most feature-rich skill-emulation module available.

**Features:**
* Highly aggressive & polished skill-emulation engine offering the lowest skill delays attainable: far surpassing NGSP, PR, free SP and Bern script in speed, responsiveness and fluidity.
* Client-side edge counter with server synchronization (further eradicating those instances where the edge counter doesn't update for an exceptionally long time, despite edge still being processed server-side).
* Fast chaining, numerous optimizations & improvements only achievable through countless hours of direct attention to the class - all contextualized through a competitive mindset.
* No ghosting (a completely ghost-free, dependable Charging Slash) and highly reliable skills.
* Stability mode enables a substantial increase to attack speed with no typical compromise in reliability.
* Blade Draw early-cancellation prevention (with a huge range of configuration options).
* Client-side Backstab (which correctly turns camera) and client-side Charging Slash (typically one or both being delayed by the server in other prediction modules).
* Accurate skill hit registration - no more skill desync, missed skills or boss collision issues robbing you of damage.
* Blade Draw, Traverse Cut & Blade Frenzy accidental slow-cast prevention.
* Backstab no-target prevention.
* Extensive configuration options available - every aspect of the module is fully customizable & in your control.
* Optional access to exclusive discord server for discussion about the module (feature requests, support), with resources to further optimize your gameplay (custom game configuration files for minimising input lag, fps enhancement, AHK).
* Suitable for players with both low & high ping.
* All races supported.
* Full glyph & EP support, knockdown, stagger & push support.
* Ping, enable/disable & many other commands.
* Continual updates & optimizations, new features and support for future patches.
